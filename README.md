# Lab-32-context-API
Getting a list of things from an API and displaying them. Allowing a User to change between light and dark mode. Snapshot testing. 
Fixed all issues, had an issue with case sensitivity for netlify deployment. Major issue with importing and passing props through component in testing files.
